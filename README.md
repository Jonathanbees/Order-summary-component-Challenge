# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card

![Design preview for the Order summary card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Difficulties and learnings! ðŸ‘‹

My major difficulty in this project was center all the items according to the template, for example, the div about the annual plan, because i didnÂ´t found how to align the title and the price in the same column, until i just add another div :)

All of that are learnings, and make easier the ways to develop a card with the css, all of this is practice!

Every comment that you have to help me to improve is very welcome :3
